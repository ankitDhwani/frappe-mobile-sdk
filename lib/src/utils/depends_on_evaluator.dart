  ///   default and never seeds through `FormController`, and `_computeUiState`
  ///   passes its raw values here directly. This is the choke point every
  ///   caller and every scope funnels through, so the default belongs here.

  ///   and in the same place. Desk stamps `__islocal = 1` next to `docstatus`
  ///   on a new doc (`create_new.js:309-310`) and drops it once the doc has a
  ///   name; Frappe's own new-doc test is exactly "either flag or no name"

  ///   true and the SDK behaves as though every document were already saved: it
  ///   SHOWS the saved-only fields Desk hides on create, and for
  ///   `read_only_depends_on` it LOCKS a field the user is there to fill in.

  ///   derives the same flag. That derivation is reactive-mode only, and

  ///   here makes the seeding belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing, exactly
  ///   as happened with `docstatus`.
  ///
  ///   The assumption it carries, stated so it is not rediscovered: a SAVED
  ///   document must have `name` in the eval scope, or it reads as local. That
  ///   is not new — `_seedDefaults` already derives from the absence of a name
  ///   — so both engines make it and agree, which is the point. An explicit

  /// The `...src` spread MUST stay FIRST. These entries are conditional
