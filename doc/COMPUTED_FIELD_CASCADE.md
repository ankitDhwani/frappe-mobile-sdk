# Computed-field cascade (Frappe `set_value` parity)

By default, a value written into the form by an [`onFieldChange`](FIELD_CHANGE_HANDLER.md)
patch (a computed value — including one your handler fetched from a linked document and
returned as a patch) does **not** re-fire that field's own change handler. So a computed
field that feeds *another* computed field stops after one hop.

This differs from Frappe Desk, where `frm.set_value(fieldname, value)` fires that field's
change trigger even for a programmatic set — so chained computations "just work".

`FrappeFormBuilder.cascadeProgrammaticChanges` restores that behaviour, opt-in.

## Why the default doesn't cascade

The change pipeline writes the patch into form state **before** calling `patchValue`:

```dart
_formData.addAll(patches);
_formKey.currentState?.patchValue(_normalizePatchValues(patches));
```

`patchValue` does re-enter the field's `onChanged` (via `didChange`), but by then
`oldValue == value` (the value is already stored), so the pipeline's own
`oldValue != value` guard no-ops it. The programmatic set never triggers the field's
`onFieldChange`.

## Enabling

```dart
FrappeFormBuilder(
  meta: meta,
  cascadeProgrammaticChanges: true, // default: false
  onFieldChange: (fieldName, value, formData) {
    if (fieldName == 'dispatch_order_id') return {'commodity_code': /* fetched */};
    if (fieldName == 'commodity_code')    return {'uom': /* fetched from commodity */};
    // With the flag on, setting commodity_code above re-fires this handler → uom.
    return null;
  },
)
```

The same flag is available on `FormScreen(cascadeProgrammaticChanges: true)` (forwarded to the
underlying legacy `FrappeFormBuilder`) and is propagated to child-table row forms, so cascade
behaves consistently inside child tables.

## Loop safety

The cascade is bounded by two independent mechanisms:

- **Value-equality (primary).** A field re-fires only when its value actually *changed*
  versus the value it held before the patch. A converged field re-emits its current value ⇒
  equal ⇒ no re-fire, so the cascade reaches a fixpoint. (A cross-field visited-set is
  deliberately **not** used — it would break legitimate fan-in, e.g. `A` sets `B` and `C`,
  both of which feed `D`.)
  On **numeric fieldtypes** (`Int`, `Float`, `Currency`, `Percent`, `Rating`) the comparison is
  numeric, so a representation-only change (`10` vs `"10.0"`) is *not* treated as a change.
  Every other fieldtype compares as trimmed strings, so an opaque id like `"007"` is still a
  real change against `"7"`.
- **Depth cap (backstop).** Recursion is capped (currently 12 levels) to bound a
  non-converging handler (e.g. an `A ↔ B` flip-flop). Hitting the cap logs via `sdkLog` and
  stops.

The synchronous `patchValue` echo is suppressed while cascading, so each handler fires
**exactly once** — this matters for typed fields whose representation `FieldNormalizer`
changes (`Check` `1`→`true`, `Date` `String`→`DateTime`, `Rating` `String`→`int`), where the
echo would otherwise not self-guard and would double-run the handler.

**Self-referential patches are safe and converge.** A handler may patch the very field that
is currently changing (e.g. normalising its own value:
`if (name == 'a') return {'a': normalise(value)}`). Two guarantees apply:

- The self-key's *widget* patch is deferred one frame, because applying it synchronously
  from inside the field's own change dispatch used to recurse unboundedly through the text
  field's controller notifications (`StackOverflowError`) whenever the handler rewrote the
  value — a pre-existing defect independent of this flag, fixed alongside it. The document
  data (`formData`) still updates immediately; only the widget sync waits a frame.
- That deferred echo is suppressed **regardless of the flag**. On a typed field the echoed
  value never equals the doc-space value (`FieldNormalizer` changed its representation), so an
  unsuppressed echo would re-fire a self-referential handler every frame — and the depth cap
  above only runs while cascading, so nothing would bound it. Suppressing it makes the echo a
  pure state-sync no-op in both flag states. (The *synchronous cross-field* echo stays
  cascade-gated, so legacy cross-field behaviour is untouched.)
- For the self-key, the "prior" value the cascade compares against is the value that was
  just set (the field's own write happens before the handler runs), so the re-fire happens
  only when the handler actually rewrote the value — an idempotent rewrite re-fires exactly
  once before value-equality reaches the fixpoint.

Both are pinned by tests (`test/widgets/form_builder_cascade_test.dart`): flag OFF fires the
handler exactly once; flag ON exactly twice (edit + one re-fire).

## Side effects and the `source` argument

Because each cascade hop re-runs the change pipeline, **`onFieldChange` is invoked more than
once for a single user edit** — once for the field the user touched, then once per computed
field down the chain (2–4× for a typical chain). Handlers enabled under this flag must
therefore be effectively *pure*: return patches, and avoid side effects (analytics events,
snackbars, running totals) that assume one call per edit.

To let a handler still run a side effect exactly once, the pipeline tags each invocation with
its `ChangeSource` (the optional named argument on `FieldChangeHandler`):

- the field the user directly edited → `ChangeSource.user`;
- every cascade re-fire → `ChangeSource.reaction` (matching the reactive `FormController`).

```dart
onFieldChange: (fieldName, value, formData, {source = ChangeSource.user}) {
  if (source == ChangeSource.user) logEdit(fieldName); // fires once per real edit
  // ... return computed patches ...
  return null;
}
```

With the flag **off** every invocation is `ChangeSource.user` (there are no re-fires), so this
is a no-op change for legacy consumers. Pinned by
`test/widgets/form_builder_cascade_test.dart`.

## Known limitation: native `fetch_from` patches don't cascade

The cascade covers exactly the patches **returned by your `onFieldChange` handler**. The
SDK's *native* `fetch_from` handling — fields whose `DocField.fetchFrom` metadata makes the
SDK itself fetch a linked document and patch targets — applies its patches through a separate
internal path that bypasses this cascade. A field populated that way will **not** re-fire
dependents' `onFieldChange`, even with `cascadeProgrammaticChanges: true`.

This matches the scope of the original issue (#82), which concerns handler-returned patches.
If your handler fetches from a linked doc and returns the result as a patch, that **is**
covered. Cascading native `fetch_from` patches may be addressed as a follow-up.

## Backwards compatibility

- **Default `false`.** With the flag off there is no cascade — no re-fire, no scheduling, no
  depth tracking. Two behaviour changes are deliberately **not** gated by the flag, both fixes
  for pre-existing defects on the self-key path: the self-key widget patch is deferred one
  frame (the `StackOverflowError` fix), and that deferred echo is suppressed (the uncapped
  typed-field hang described above). Both affect only a handler that rewrites the field
  currently changing; the document data still updates synchronously — only the widget sync
  waits a frame.
- **Per-form.** Enable it only on forms whose `onFieldChange` handlers are known to be safe to
  re-enter. Handlers that issue network calls on change should be reviewed before enabling, so
  a cascade doesn't fan out unexpected requests.
- **Deterministic.** With the flag off there is no cascade re-fire and no depth tracking. The
  one piece of scheduling that remains is the deferred self-key widget patch described above —
  so "no scheduling with the flag off" is true for every path *except* a handler that patches
  the field currently changing.
